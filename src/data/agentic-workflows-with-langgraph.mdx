# What is an Agent?

An **Agent** is like an AI worker that:

- Can **think** (use logic)  
- Can **decide** (based on the input)  
- Can **act** (perform a task or call a tool)  

You can imagine an agent as an intelligent assistant that doesn’t just respond, but knows how to break a problem into steps, use tools, and adapt based on what’s happening.

# What is Agentic Workflow?

An **agentic workflow** is a process where an AI takes initiative, makes decisions, and executes tasks step by step — often using tools, memory, and feedback to achieve a goal.

### Example:
**Question**: "Who should bowl the final over?"

**AI:**
- Checks who has overs left  
- Looks at stats for death overs  
- Considers match pressure  
- Picks: **"Give Bumrah the final over."**

---

# Importance

In modern AI applications (like chatbots or decision-making bots), we don’t want AI to just respond — we want it to:

- Understand **context**  
- Use the **right tools**  
- Adapt its **behavior**  
- Make **smart, evolving decisions**  

This is fulfilled using **Agentic AI**, which powers advanced systems like personal assistants, trading bots, gaming AIs, and more.

# Problems in Building Agentic Workflow Manually

Trying to build an agentic workflow without a proper framework is like planning a cricket match on sticky notes — it works, but it’s chaotic.

### 1. Too much logic to manage
Say you're building an AI to handle the last 5 overs.  
It needs to check run rate, bowler form, injury status, and more.  
All those if-else conditions get messy fast.

### 2. Too many moving parts
A smart agent may need to:
- Fetch live stats  
- Use tools (like calculators or search)  
- Track who’s bowled already  

Manually connecting these pieces is time-consuming and fragile.

### 3. No Memory Retention
The AI might know Bumrah did well earlier — but remembering that later isn’t easy without a memory system.  
You’ll end up rewriting a lot of glue code just to pass data around.

# What is LangGraph?

**LangGraph** is a Python framework (built on **LangChain**) that helps you create **agentic workflows like a flowchart**.

Instead of writing messy if-else logic, you define:

- **Steps** (called nodes)  
- **How data flows** between them (like edges in a graph)  
- **What happens at each point** (e.g. run a tool, make a decision, etc.)

---

# How LangGraph Solves the Problem of Manual Agentic Workflows

- **Clear Logic Flow** → You define steps and their connections visually (no messy if-else chains).  
- **Built-in Memory** → LangGraph shares state across steps, so data naturally flows through the workflow.  
- **Easy to Visualize & Debug** → The workflow is graph-based, making it easy to understand and maintain.  
- **Support for Streaming & Checkpoints** → Ideal for workflows that require long thinking or real-time feedback.  
- **Modular & Reusable** → Each node does one job — you can reuse or replace steps like LEGO blocks.

# Example

## Setup

```bash
pip install langgraph openai python-dotenv pydantic typing-extensions

# 🏏 Cricket Strategy Agent with LangGraph

```python
# Imports
from openai import OpenAI
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from typing_extensions import TypedDict
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import Literal

# Load Environment & Initialize client
load_dotenv()
client = OpenAI()

# Define the State
class State(TypedDict):
    match_context: str
    is_critical_over: bool | None
    selected_bowler: str | None

# Define GPT output schema using Pydantic
class ClassifyCrucialOver(BaseModel):
    is_critical_over: bool

# Defining the Nodes

# Node 1 - Analyze the situation of the match
def analyze_match(state: State):
    match_context = state["match_context"]

    SYSTEM_PROMPT = """
    You are a Cricket Strategist. You will be given a match situation and your job is to decide whether the current over is a Crucial Over or not from the perspective of the Bowling Team.

    Return the response in specified JSON BOOLEAN only
    """

    response = client.beta.chat.completions.parse(
        model="gpt-4.1",
        response_format=ClassifyCrucialOver,
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": SYSTEM_PROMPT},
            {"role": "user", "content": match_context}
        ]
    )

    is_critical_over = response.choices[0].message.parsed.is_critical_over

    state["is_critical_over"] = is_critical_over
    return state

# Node 2 - Route based on Analysis
def route_query(state: State) -> Literal["critical_over", "normal_over"]:
    is_critical = state["is_critical_over"]

    if is_critical:
        return "critical_over"
    return "normal_over"

# Decision Nodes
def critical_over(state: State):
    state["selected_bowler"] = "Bumrah"
    return state

def normal_over(state: State):
    state["selected_bowler"] = "Kuldeep"
    return state

# Build the LangGraph
graph_builder = StateGraph(State)

graph_builder.add_node("analyze_match", analyze_match)
graph_builder.add_node("critical_over", critical_over)
graph_builder.add_node("normal_over", normal_over)

graph_builder.add_edge(START, "analyze_match")
graph_builder.add_conditional_edges("analyze_match", route_query)

graph_builder.add_edge("critical_over", END)
graph_builder.add_edge("normal_over", END)

graph = graph_builder.compile()

# Execution
def main():
    context = input("Enter the match situation (e.g 12 runs in 6 balls) : ")

    _state: State = {
        "match_context": context,
        "is_critical_over": None,
        "selected_bowler": None
    }

    result = graph.invoke(_state)
    print("Response : ", result)
    print("✅ Final Decision: ", result["selected_bowler"])

main()
